# airbnb-clone-project
**📌 Overview**
The Airbnb Clone Project is a learning-focused initiative designed to simulate the backend of a modern booking platform. The project introduces learners to full-stack development practices with an emphasis on backend architecture, database design, API development, and deployment workflows.

---

**🎯 Goals**
- Build a scalable backend system capable of managing users, properties, and reservations.

- Practice collaborative development workflows using GitHub.

- Implement secure authentication and data handling.

- Explore continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) pipelines.

---

**🛠️ Tech Stack**

- Backend Framework: Django (Python)

- Database: MySQL

- APIs: REST / GraphQL

- Tools: Git, Docker, GitHub Actions

- Set up CI/CD pipelines for testing and deployment.

---

**Team Roles**
- Backend Developer – Implements APIs, business logic, and ensures smooth communication between the app and the database.

- Database Administrator (DBA) – Designs, manages, and optimizes the database for performance and reliability.

- Quality Assurance (QA) Engineer – Creates and runs tests to detect bugs early and ensure software quality.

- DevOps Engineer – Manages infrastructure, CI/CD pipelines, and deployment for scalable, reliable operations.

- Project Manager (PM) – Oversees timelines, coordinates tasks, and ensures alignment with project goals.

- Software Architect – Defines the system architecture, chooses technologies, and enforces coding standards.

  ---

**Technology Stack**

- Django – A high-level Python web framework used to build and manage the backend API and application logic.

- PostgreSQL – A relational database system used to store and manage structured data such as users, listings, and bookings.

- GraphQL – A query language for APIs that enables efficient data fetching and flexible client-server communication.

- Docker – A containerization platform that ensures consistency across development and deployment environments.

- GitHub Actions – A CI/CD tool used to automate testing, integration, and deployment workflows.

**Database Design**
For this project, the database will have a few main entities:

- Users --->

 [Fields: id, name, email, role (guest or host)]

- Properties --->

[Fields: id, host_id, title, location, price]

- Bookings --->

[Fields: id, user_id, property_id, start_date, end_date]

- Reviews --->

[Fields: id, user_id, property_id, rating, comment]

- Payments --->

[Fields: id, booking_id, amount, status]

<---How they connect--->

- A user can be a guest or a host.

- A host can have many properties.

- A guest can make many bookings, but each booking is for one property.

- A property can have many reviews, and reviews come from users.

- Each booking has one payment attached to it.

---

**Feature Breakdown**

- User Management ---> lets people sign up, log in, and manage their profiles. This is important because without users, the app can’t have hosts or guests.

- Property Management ---> allows hosts to add, edit, and remove property listings. This makes it possible for guests to see available places to book.

- Booking System ---> enables guests to book properties for specific dates. This is the main feature of the app since it connects guests with hosts.

- Reviews ---> lets guests leave ratings and comments on properties. This builds trust and helps future guests make informed choices.

- Payments ---> processes transactions for bookings. This ensures that hosts get paid and guests have a secure way to pay.
---

**API Security**

- Authentication ---> makes sure only registered users can log in and use the system. This protects user accounts from unauthorized access.

- Authorization ---> controls what different users (guest or host) are allowed to do. For example, only hosts can add properties.

- Rate Limiting ---> prevents too many requests from one user or bot. This helps stop misuse of the system and keeps it running smoothly.

- Data Protection ---> sensitive data like passwords and payment info must be encrypted. This keeps private information safe.
---

**CI/CD Pipeline**

- A CI/CD pipeline automates the process of testing and deploying code so developers don’t have to do it manually each time. This makes development faster and reduces errors.

- GitHub Actions ---> can run automated tests whenever new code is pushed.

- Docker ---> makes sure the app runs the same way on every computer.

- CI/CD Benefits ---> saves time, makes deployments easier, and helps catch bugs early.
